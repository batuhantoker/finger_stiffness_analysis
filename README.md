# A framework to understand human finger stiffness changing capabilities
A framework to analyze human finger kinematics, force capabilities, impedance modulation characteristics using sensory measurements.

## Signal processing
Tools that can be used to process any signal, the provided ones are specialized for 2D arrays as we analyze mostly multi-channel sensory measurements.

## EMG feature extraction
Definitions of extracted features

## Classification algorithms
A function to evaluate efficiency of multiple classifier within a function

## Regression algorithms
